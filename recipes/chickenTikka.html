<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>500g boneless chicken (cut into bite-sized pieces)</li>
    <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ginger paste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons garlic paste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Kashmiri red chili powder (for color and mild heat)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li><b>Prepare the Chicken:</b> Wash the boneless chicken pieces thoroughly under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and set aside.
</li>
    <li><b>Mix Yogurt and Spices: </b>In a large mixing bowl, combine the plain yogurt, ginger paste, garlic paste, lemon juice, Kashmiri red chili powder, ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt to taste. Stir well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.

</li>
    <li><b>Marinate the Chicken:</b> Add the chicken pieces to the bowl with the marinade. Ensure that each piece is thoroughly coated with the marinade. Use your hands or a spoon to mix and massage the marinade into the chicken, making sure it penetrates all the pieces.</li>
    <li><b>Cover and Refrigerate:</b> Once the chicken is evenly coated with the marinade, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid. Place it in the refrigerator and let the chicken marinate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight. Marinating overnight will allow the flavors to develop and the chicken to become more tender and flavorful.</li>
    <li><b>Optional: Skewering:</b> If you're planning to grill the chicken, thread the marinated chicken pieces onto skewers, leaving a little space between each piece. If you're baking the chicken, you can skip this step.</li>
