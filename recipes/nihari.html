<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 kg beef shank (cut into large pieces)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup oil</li>
    <li>2 large onions (finely sliced)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ginger paste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons garlic paste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon wheat flour (roasted)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Water (as needed)</li>
    <li>Fresh cilantro, lemon wedges, and sliced ginger (for garnish)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li><b>Prepare the Beef:</b> Wash the beef shank pieces thoroughly under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. Set aside.</li>
    <li><b>Sauté the Onions:</b> In a large pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until golden brown. Remove half of the onions and set aside for garnishing.</li>
    <li><b>Cook the Beef:</b> Add the ginger paste, garlic paste, and beef pieces to the pot. Cook until the beef is browned on all sides.</li>
    <li><b>Add Spices and Water:</b> Add the ground cumin, ground coriander, chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt to the pot. Stir well to coat the beef with the spices. Add enough water to cover the beef and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li><b>Simmer:</b> Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the beef simmer for 4-6 hours, stirring occasionally. The beef should be tender and the broth should be rich and flavorful.</li>
    <li><b>Thicken the Broth:</b> In a small bowl, mix the roasted wheat flour with a little water to form a smooth paste. Gradually add this paste to the simmering Nihari, stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Cook for another 15-20 minutes until the broth thickens.</li>
    <li><b>Serve:</b> Serve the hot Nihari in bowls, garnished with the reserved fried onions, fresh cilantro, lemon wedges, and sliced ginger. Enjoy with naan or paratha.</li>
