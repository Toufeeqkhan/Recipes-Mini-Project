<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons oil</li>
    <li>Water (as needed)</li>
    <li>2 large potatoes (boiled and diced)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup peas</li>
    <li>1 onion (finely chopped)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ginger paste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons garlic paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Oil for frying</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li><b>Prepare the Dough:</b> In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, 4 tablespoons of oil, and a pinch of salt. Gradually add water and knead until you form a smooth dough. Cover and set aside for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li><b>Make the Filling:</b> Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle. Add the chopped onion, ginger paste, and garlic paste, and sauté until golden brown. Add the diced potatoes, peas, ground coriander, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt to taste. Stir well and cook for a few minutes until everything is well combined and heated through.</li>
    <li><b>Shape the Samosas:</b> Divide the dough into small balls and roll each ball into a thin circle. Cut the circle in half to form two semi-circles. Take one semi-circle, fold it into a cone shape, and seal the edge with a little water. Fill the cone with the potato filling and seal the top edge with water.</li>
    <li><b>Fry the Samosas:</b> Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Carefully add the samosas to the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</li>
    <li><b>Serve:</b> Serve the hot samosas with mint chutney, tamarind sauce, or your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
